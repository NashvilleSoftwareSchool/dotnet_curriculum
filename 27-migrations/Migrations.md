# Migrations

### Migrations Setup
https://gist.github.com/jcockhren/4d58d603920c39f29f45
[Migrations_Setup.md]
  1. From the menu, Go to Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console
  2. Follow Steps in commits to ready project for migrations [ https://github.com/NashvilleSoftwareSchool/jitter-juniper/compare/625cb9f9a339e243fb1d3c3a1f03d3d301cb9c60...103d40c?diff=split&name=103d40c ] and then:

    `PM> Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName ProjectName.Models.ProjectNameContext`

      where "ProjectName" is your project's name.  
      N.B.  This step only ever needs to be done once (do not need to redo for scorched earth)
  3. In order to Create an initial migration :
	`PM> Add-Migration InitialCreate`
  4. To apply that migration:
	`PM> Update-Database`

### Initial Migration
https://gist.github.com/jcockhren/243d76d925d51abcb3df [instructions.md]
  1. `PM> Update-Database -TargetMigration $InitialDatabase` (Deletes all tables in database, but keeps Database file)
  2. If you have a file with the name `InitialCreate1` delete it. If it's not there, no worries.
  3. `PM> Add-Migration InitialCreate` (re-create InitialCreate migration file with your new model's changes)
  4. `PM> Update-Database` (now apply the newly created migration)

### Adding a Migration
  0. Make any necessary changes to your model
  1. `PM> Add-Migration <NameForNewMigration>` ('NameForNewMigration' should reflect your new model's changes)
  2. `PM> Update-Database` (now apply the newly created migration)

### To Re-Create Database File ("Scorched Earth")
https://gist.github.com/jcockhren/d92140ce675e0b62fa4f  [database_file_recreate.md]
  1. Go to your project and right-Click on `App_Data` Then select Open in File Explorer
  2. In your Server Explorer, under `Data Connections`, delete both connections (`DefaultConnection` and ProjectName.mdf)
  3. Delete the Database FILES in the directory from #1.
  4. In your Package Manager Console Run
  `PM> Update-Database`
